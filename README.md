# Fractol-42

## This is my second graphics project at 42

*Summary: This project is meant to create graphically beautiful fractals.* :milky_way:

A fractal is an abstract mathematical object, like a curve or a surface, which has a similar pattern whatever the scale.Various natural phenomena – like the romanesco cabbage, trees, snowflakes – have some fractal features.

**Supported features include:**

* Zooming in and out
* Change of colors (press 1, 2 or 3 to choose the color set)
